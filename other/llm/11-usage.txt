## Overview

### General Statement
The data used in this paper comes from two distinct sources, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **BodyM Dataset**  
   This dataset, obtained from Amazon Web Services (AWS) [@ref], is used as training data for the model to predict body fat categories. It includes silhouettes of real test subjects to capture accurate body compositions. These silhouettes were collected to support the estimation of bodily measurements using Machine Learning techniques [@ref]. However, the silhouettes are not used in this paper.

2. **Body Composition Dataset**  
   This dataset, referred to as the Body Composition dataset for the purposes of this paper, was collected for estimating a new body fat measurement technique by Isaac Kuzmar et al. [@ref]. It is used to calculate fat percentages based on actual body composition and serves as a comparison for the model’s predictions.

The BodyM Dataset, refered to teh Body Measurements dataset throughout this paper, was collected for [Ruiz2022] Ruiz Et Al. in their paper with a focus on underrepresented body types in estimation of fat and its susbquent health risks. The main data captured from this collection was the front and lateral silhouttes of [2000something] test subjects. These silhouttes were then converted to black and white images to be used by their augementation model. The subjects include X male and Y female aged A to B. The body measurements in this dataset were generated through their adversarial body simulator (ABS). The ABS was specifically modeled to capture underrespresented body types. The S3 [reference] package included 3 datasets: training, Test A and Test B. This paper uses the training dataset. The visual images of test subjects were photographed and 3D-scanned by lab technicians.

The BodyM Dataset, referred to as the Body Measurements dataset throughout this paper, was collected by Ruiz et al. [@Ruiz2022] with a focus on underrepresented body types in the estimation of fat and its subsequent health risks. The primary data captured in this collection consists of the front and lateral silhouettes of approximately [2000] test subjects. These silhouettes were then converted into black-and-white images for use in their augmentation model. The dataset includes X male and Y female subjects, aged A to B. The body measurements in this dataset were generated using their Adversarial Body Simulator (ABS), which was specifically designed to capture underrepresented body types. The S3 package [@reference] included three datasets: Training, Test A, and Test B. For the purposes of this paper, only the Training dataset is used. The visual images of the test subjects were photographed and 3D-scanned by lab technicians.

For this paper, this dataset is used to estimate the category of body fat that a person carries. To effectively differentiate the different body types, the model considers measurements that could indicate actual body compositions. I chose gender, height and weight and basic predictors for the model. However, according to [reference, WHO], waist-to-hip ratio is more accurate to predict levels of body fat in a person. Based on [reference], the two sexes have different tendencies of excess body fat collection also known as [adipose fat]. In males, excess body fat tends to collect in the abdominal region, whereas in females, fat collects in the hips. This ratio is indicative of fat accumulation and a higher ratio can be used as a precursor indicator for obesity [reference]. 

To consider body composition along the height of a person, a new variable called height-to-hip ratio, height_hip_ratio, was created. [referernce], something like two people with the same WHR could differ in the fat category that they belong to depending on the height. A tall person with a higher WHR is at a lower risk of developing cardiovascular risks than a shorter person with the same height [reference].

Lastly, to improve the quality of the model, I also selected ankle and wrist circumference measurements. [reference], [this is important for boundary values].

Here’s the refined version of your paragraph:

For this paper, the BodyM Dataset is used to estimate the category of body fat that a person carries. To effectively differentiate between the various body types, the model takes into account measurements that could indicate actual body compositions. Gender, height, and weight are used as basic predictors for the model. However, according to [@reference, WHO], the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is a more accurate predictor of body fat levels. Based on [@reference], the two sexes exhibit different tendencies for excess body fat accumulation, also known as adipose fat. In males, excess fat tends to accumulate in the abdominal region, whereas in females, fat is more commonly stored in the hips. This ratio is indicative of fat distribution, and a higher WHR can be a precursor indicator of obesity [@reference].

To better account for body composition in relation to height, a new variable called height-to-hip ratio (height_hip_ratio) was introduced. As noted by [@reference], two individuals with the same WHR could differ in their fat category depending on height. For instance, a taller person with a higher WHR may face a lower risk of developing cardiovascular issues than a shorter person with the same WHR [@reference].

Finally, to enhance the model’s quality, ankle and wrist circumference measurements were also included. These measurements are particularly important for determining boundary values for fat classification [@reference].

- I wanted to provide a categorisation of fat levels in an indivual based on simple measurements. Using measurements such as height and weight that are used in the formula and WHR and ankle and wrist measurements, I wanted to capture a person's body compositon as much as possible. i expected that there is a positve relationship between a person's excess body fat levels and their WHR. In addition to WHR, the height if a person is also important to capture the distribution of fat, a short person with a high WHR would be at a higher risk of obesity related diseases.

Here’s a refined version of your thoughts:

I aimed to provide a categorization of body fat levels in an individual based on simple measurements. By using measurements such as height, weight, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and ankle and wrist circumference, I sought to capture a person’s body composition as accurately as possible. I expected a positive relationship between excess body fat levels and WHR. Additionally, height is an important factor to consider in capturing fat distribution—specifically, a shorter person with a high WHR would be at a higher risk of obesity-related diseases.

Men are more likely to accumulate fat in the abdominal region, while women tend to store fat in the hip area. To capture natural body shapes and leanness, I also considered other factors that influence body composition, such as [include additional measurements or considerations].
