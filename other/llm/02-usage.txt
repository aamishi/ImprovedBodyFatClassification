To simulate data in R based on the provided column names, we can create a synthetic dataset with random values for each of the columns. Here's a basic code to simulate this data:

r
Copy code
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility

# Number of rows to simulate
n <- 1000

# Simulate the columns
body_mass_model <- data.frame(
  gender = sample(c("Male", "Female"), n, replace = TRUE),
  age = sample(18:80, n, replace = TRUE),
  height = rnorm(n, mean = 170, sd = 10),  # average height with some variability
  weight = rnorm(n, mean = 70, sd = 15),   # average weight with some variability
  bmi = rnorm(n, mean = 25, sd = 5),       # typical BMI range
  fat_mass_kg = rnorm(n, mean = 15, sd = 5), 
  fm = rnorm(n, mean = 20, sd = 8),        # fat mass in kg
  ffm_kg = rnorm(n, mean = 50, sd = 10),   # fat-free mass in kg
  bone_mass_kg = rnorm(n, mean = 3, sd = 1),
  muscle_mass_kg = rnorm(n, mean = 30, sd = 7),
  bmr_kcal = rnorm(n, mean = 1500, sd = 300),  # basal metabolic rate
  fm_trunk = rnorm(n, mean = 7, sd = 2),   # fat mass in trunk area
  bmi_category = sample(c("Underweight", "Normal", "Overweight", "Obese"), n, replace = TRUE),
  fat_percentage_category = sample(c("Low", "Moderate", "High", "Extreme"), n, replace = TRUE),
  height_category = sample(c("Short", "Average", "Tall"), n, replace = TRUE),
  predicted_category = sample(c("Low", "Moderate", "High", "Extreme"), n, replace = TRUE),
  weight_category = sample(c("Underweight", "Normal", "Overweight", "Obese"), n, replace = TRUE)
)

head(body_mass_model)
This code simulates data for each of the specified columns with random values for categories and continuous variables. You can adjust the means and standard deviations to better fit your specific needs for the data.

Here are some basic tests you can write to validate the simulated body_mass_model data in R. These tests ensure that the data meets expected criteria, such as data type correctness, value ranges, and logical consistency.

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries for testing
library(testthat)

# 1. Test if the data frame has the correct number of rows and columns
test_that("Data frame has correct number of rows and columns", {
  expect_equal(ncol(body_mass_model), 17)  # Should have 17 columns
  expect_equal(nrow(body_mass_model), 1000)  # Should have 1000 rows
})

# 2. Test if the gender column contains only valid values (Male, Female)
test_that("Gender column contains only valid values", {
  expect_true(all(body_mass_model$gender %in% c("Male", "Female")))
})

# 3. Test if age column is within the expected range (18 to 80 years)
test_that("Age column is within the expected range", {
  expect_true(all(body_mass_model$age >= 18 & body_mass_model$age <= 80))
})

# 4. Test if height column has values greater than zero
test_that("Height column has positive values", {
  expect_true(all(body_mass_model$height > 0))
})

# 5. Test if weight column has values greater than zero
test_that("Weight column has positive values", {
  expect_true(all(body_mass_model$weight > 0))
})

# 6. Test if bmi column has valid values within a reasonable range (e.g., 10 to 50)
test_that("BMI column is within a reasonable range", {
  expect_true(all(body_mass_model$bmi >= 10 & body_mass_model$bmi <= 50))
})

# 7. Test if fat_mass_kg column has non-negative values
test_that("Fat mass column has non-negative values", {
  expect_true(all(body_mass_model$fat_mass_kg >= 0))
})

# 8. Test if fat percentage categories are valid
test_that("Fat percentage category column contains valid categories", {
  expect_true(all(body_mass_model$fat_percentage_category %in% c("Low", "Moderate", "High", "Extreme")))
})

# 9. Test if bmi_category column contains valid categories
test_that("BMI category column contains valid categories", {
  expect_true(all(body_mass_model$bmi_category %in% c("Underweight", "Normal", "Overweight", "Obese")))
})

# 10. Test if height_category column contains valid categories
test_that("Height category column contains valid categories", {
  expect_true(all(body_mass_model$height_category %in% c("Short", "Average", "Tall")))
})

# 11. Test if predicted_category column contains valid categories
test_that("Predicted category column contains valid categories", {
  expect_true(all(body_mass_model$predicted_category %in% c("Low", "Moderate", "High", "Extreme")))
})

# 12. Test if weight_category column contains valid categories
test_that("Weight category column contains valid categories", {
  expect_true(all(body_mass_model$weight_category %in% c("Underweight", "Normal", "Overweight", "Obese")))
})

# 13. Test if there are no missing values in the data frame
test_that("No missing values in the data", {
  expect_true(all(!is.na(body_mass_model)))
})

# 14. Test if body mass values are logically consistent (fat_mass_kg + ffm_kg should be close to weight)
test_that("Fat mass + Fat-free mass is close to weight", {
  expect_true(all(abs((body_mass_model$fat_mass_kg + body_mass_model$ffm_kg) - body_mass_model$weight) < 10))
})

# 15. Test if fat mass percentage is within a reasonable range (0 to 100)
test_that("Fat mass percentage is within a reasonable range", {
  fat_percentage <- (body_mass_model$fat_mass_kg / body_mass_model$weight) * 100
  expect_true(all(fat_percentage >= 0 & fat_percentage <= 100))
})
Explanation of the tests:
Correct number of rows and columns: Checks if the simulated dataset has 17 columns and 1000 rows.
Gender values: Verifies that the gender column only contains "Male" or "Female".
Age range: Ensures the age is between 18 and 80 years.
Height and weight validity: Verifies that both height and weight are positive values.
BMI range: Checks if the BMI values fall within a reasonable range (10 to 50).
Fat mass: Ensures that fat mass values are non-negative.
Categories validation: Checks if categorical columns like bmi_category, fat_percentage_category, etc., contain only valid predefined categories.
Logical consistency: Tests the relationship between fat mass, fat-free mass, and total weight to ensure they make sense.
No missing values: Ensures the dataset does not contain any missing values.
Fat percentage calculation: Verifies that the fat mass percentage is between 0% and 100%.
You can run these tests in R to validate the simulated dataset.
