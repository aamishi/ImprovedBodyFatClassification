# Introduction

BMI is a common indicator for general health but it has its limitations. It does not take into consideration the actual body composition of an individual and other important factors such as sex and age. Through this paper, I would like to propose a new way categorising people based on other body measurements such as the waist-to-hip ratio and wrist and ankle circumferences measurements as they are more indicative of a person's visceral fat, this proving a more accurate representation of general health. I would like to propose a newer formula for General Health Index (GHI) through the BodyM dataset. I plan on using the Isaac Kuzmar dataset that has accurate measurements of body fat to create a Confusion Matrix to see how my model compares in providing more accurate body fat estimations through easlily measurable data such as waist and hip circumference.

## Overview


Overview text

## Measurement
	
Some paragraphs about how we go from a phenomena in the world to an entry in the dataset.


```{r}
#| label: fig-bills
#| fig-cap: Bills of penguins
#| echo: false
```

Talk more about it.


```{r}

```

Talk way more about it. 

## Predictor variables

Add graphs, tables and text.

Use sub-sub-headings for each outcome variable and feel free to combine a few into one if they go together naturally.








# Model

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.  

\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

We run the model in R [@citeR] using the `rstanarm` package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from `rstanarm`.


### Model justification

We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular...

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.

# Discussion

## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}

If my paper were 10 pages, then should be be at least 2.5 pages. The discussion is a chance to show off what you know and what you learnt from all this. 

## Second discussion point

Please don't use these as sub-heading labels - change them to be what your point actually is.

## Third discussion point

## Weaknesses and next steps

Weaknesses and next steps should also be included.
